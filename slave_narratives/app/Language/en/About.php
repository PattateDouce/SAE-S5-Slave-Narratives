    I work on slave narratives published before the Civil War and I quickly realized that the list of narratives does not have consensus among researchers and those who propose a list do not really explain on what criteria the narratives are included and the lists differ. The purpose of this site is therefore to present a list as exhaustive as possible of the stories that are cited by the various researchers but with comments on what makes them (or not) slave stories. For now we focus on the stories written before the Civil War but it is not excluded that the site evolves and that it also includes the stories written after.',

    Sarah Wroblewski, Lazare Sauger Chevillot and Léo Le Gourriérec, students in Master 1 SIGMA developed the cards then Florent Laidin, student in Master 2 SIGMA created the site with the help of these cards (Louise Thomas also contributed to the site through her work on security issues). All this would not have been possible without the help of Mr. Laurent Jégou, co-head of the Master SIGMA, his help and advice (which were beyond the mere supervision of the design offices) were valuable. 
    I also thank, always, Nathalie Dessens, my thesis director, for her encouragement, advice and support for what was a little crazy idea at first.',
